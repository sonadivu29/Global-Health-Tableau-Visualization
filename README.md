# Global-Health-Tableau-Visualization
A Tableau project visualizing global health indicators like life expectancy, GDP, healthcare spending, and immunization.

# 🌍 Global Health Dashboard 📊

This Tableau project visualizes critical global health indicators such as **Life Expectancy**, **Healthcare Spending**, **GDP per Capita**, **Adult Mortality**, and **Immunization Rates** across different countries. The dashboard helps uncover trends, correlations, and disparities in health outcomes around the world.

## 📊 Key Dashboards & Visuals

- **Life Expectancy Map** – Geographical view of life expectancy distribution.
- **GDP vs Life Expectancy** – Correlation between economy and health.
- **Adult Mortality Trends** – Highlights mortality disparities.
- **Healthcare Spending Analysis** – Spending patterns across countries.
- **Immunization Coverage** – Effect of vaccines on mortality and LE.
- **LE Trend & Status** – Trends over time and country categorization.

## 💡 Insights Gained

- Countries with **higher GDP and health spending** tend to have **higher life expectancy**.
- Regions with **low immunization coverage** often face higher **adult mortality**.
- **Economic resources** are strongly linked to **health outcomes**, though some countries achieve high LE with moderate spending (indicating efficiency).
- Clear **regional disparities** in health indicators emphasize the need for targeted interventions.
